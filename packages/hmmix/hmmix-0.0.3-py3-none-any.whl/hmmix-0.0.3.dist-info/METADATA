# Introgression detection
These are the scripts needed to infere archaic introgression in modern populations using an unadmixed outgroup.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```python
pip install hmmix 
```
If you want to work with bcf/vcf files I would also install vcftools and bcftools. You can either use conda or visit their websites.
```python
conda install -c bioconda vcftools bcftools
```


![Overview of model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30321818/43464826-4d11d46c-94dc-11e8-8f1a-6851aa5d9125.jpg)

The way the model works is by removing variation found in an outgroup population and then using the remaining variants to group the genome into regions of different variant density. If the model works well we would expect that introgressed regions have higher variant density than non-introgressed - because they have spend more time accumulation variation that is not found in the outgroup.

An example on simulated data is provided below:

![het_vs_archaic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30321818/46877046-217eff80-ce40-11e8-9010-edb544e3e1ee.png)

In this example we zoom in on 1 Mb of simulated data for a haploid genome. The top panel shows the coalescence times with the outgroup across the region and the green segment is an archaic introgressed segment. Notice how much more deeper the coalescence time with the outgroup is. The second panel shows that probability of being in the archaic state. We can see that the probability is much higher in the archaic segment, demonstrating that in this toy example the model is working like we would hope. The next panel is the snp density if you dont remove all snps found in the outgroup. By looking at this one cant tell where the archaic segments begins and ends, or even if there is one. The bottom panel is the snp density when all variation in the outgroup is removed. Notice that now it is much clearer where the archaic segment begins and ends!

The method is now published in PlosGenetics and can be found here: [Detecting archaic introgression using an unadmixed outgroup](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007641) This paper is describing and evaluating the method.

## Quick tutorial

Lets make some test data and start using the program.
```
> hmmix make_test_data
making test data...
creating 2 chromosomes with 50 Mb of test data (100K bins) with the following parameters..

State names: ['Human' 'Archaic']
Starting_probabilities: [0.98 0.02]
Transition matrix: 
[[9.999e-01 1.000e-04]
 [2.000e-02 9.800e-01]]
Emission values: [0.04 0.4 ]
```
This will generate 4 files, obs.txt, weights.bed, mutrates.bed and Initialguesses.json. 

obs.txt. These are the mutation that are left after removing variants which are found in the outgroup.
```
chrom  pos     ancestral_base  genotype
chr1   5212    A               AG
chr1   32198   A               AG
chr1   65251   C               CG

chr1   218969  A               AT
```
weights.bed. This is the parts of the genome that we can accurately map to - in this case we have simulated the data and can accurately access the entire genome.
```
chr1	1	50000000
chr2	1	50000000
```
mutrates.bed. This is the normalized mutation rate across the genome (in bins of 1 Mb).
```
chr1  0        1000000   1
chr1  1000000  2000000   1
chr1  2000000  3000000   1
chr1  3000000  4000000   1
chr1  4000000  5000000   1
chr1  5000000  6000000   1
chr1  6000000  7000000   1
chr1  7000000  8000000   1
chr1  8000000  9000000   1
chr1  9000000  10000000  1
```
Initialguesses.json. This is our initial guesses when training the model - note these are different from those we simulated from.
```json
{
  "state_names": ["Human","Archaic"],
  "starting_probabilities": [0.5,0.5],
  "transitions": [[0.99,0.01],[0.02,0.98]],
  "emissions": [0.03,0.3]
}
```
We can find the best fitting parameters using BaumWelsch training - note you can try to ommit the weights and mutrates arguments. Since this is simulated data the mutation is constant across the genome and we can asses the entire genome. Also notice how the parameters approach the parameters the data was generated from (jubii).
```bash
> hmmix train  -obs=obs.txt -weights=weights.bed -mutrates=mutrates.bed -param=Initialguesses.json -out=trained.json

# run without mutrate and weights (only do this for simulated data)
> hmmix train  -obs=obs.txt -param=Initialguesses.json -out=trained.json
```

We can now decode the data with the best parameters that maximize the likelihood and find the archaic segments:

```bash
> hmmix decode -obs=obs.txt -weights=weights.bed -mutrates=mutrates.bed -param=trained.json

## Example with 1000 genomes data
I thought it would be nice to have an entire reproduceble example of how to use this model. From a common starting point such as a VCF file (well a BCF file in this case) to the final output.  The reason for using BCF files is because it is MUCH faster to extract data for each individual. You can convert a vcf file to a bcf file like this:

```bash
bcftools view file.vcf -l 1 -O b > file.bcf
bcftools index file.bcf
```

In this example I will analyse an individual (HG00096) from the 1000 genomes project phase 3.

First we will need to know which 1) bases can be called in the genome and 2) which variants are found in the outgroup. So let's start out by downloading the files from the following directories.
To download callability regions, ancestral alleles information, ingroup outgroup information call this command:

```bash


# bcffiles (hg19)
ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/bcf_files/

# callability (remember to remove chr in the beginning of each line to make it compatible with hg19 e.g. chr1 > 1)
ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/20141020.strict_mask.whole_genome.bed
sed 's/^chr\|%$//g' 20141020.strict_mask.whole_genome.bed | awk '{print $1"\t"$2"\t"$3}' > strickmask.bed

# outgroup information
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel

# Ancestral information
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-74/fasta/ancestral_alleles/homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71.tar.bz2
```

For this example we will use all individuals from 'YRI','MSL' and 'ESN' as outgroup individuals. While we will only be decoding hG00096 in this example you can add as many individuals as you want to the ingroup.  

```json
{
  "ingroup": [
    "HG00096",
    "HG00097"
  ],
  "outgroup": [
    "HG02922",
    "HG02923",
    ...
    "HG02944",
    "HG02946"]
}
```
This is how we would call archaic segments in an individual. First we need to find a set of variants found in the outgroup. We can use the wildcard character to loop through all bcf files. If you dont have ancestral information you can skip the ancestral argument.
```bash
(took an hour) > hmmix create_outgroup -ind=individuals.json -vcf=*.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=outgroup.txt -ancestral=homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_*.fa

# Alternative usage (if you only have a few individual in the outgroup you can also provide a comma separated list)
> hmmix create_outgroup -ind=HG02922,HG02923,HG02938 -vcf=*.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=outgroup.txt -ancestral=homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_*.fa

# Alternative usage (if you have no ancestral information)
> hmmix create_outgroup -ind=individuals.json -vcf=*.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=outgroup.txt 

# Alternative usage (if you only want to run the model on a subset of chromosomes, with or without ancestral information)
> hmmix create_outgroup -ind=individuals.json -vcf=chr1.bcf,chr2.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=outgroup.txt

> hmmix create_outgroup -ind=individuals.json -vcf=chr1.bcf,chr2.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=outgroup.txt -ancestral=homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_1.fa,homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_2.fa
```

We can use the number of variants in the outgroup to estimate the substitution rate as a proxy for mutation rate.
```bash
(took 30 sec) > hmmix mutation_rate -outgroup=outgroup.txt  -weights=strickmask.bed -window_size=1000000 -out mutationrate.bed
```
Keep variants that are not found to be derived in the outgroup for each individual in ingroup. You can also speficy a single individual or a comma separated list of individuals.
```bash
# Different way to define which individuals are in the ingroup
(took 20 min) > hmmix create_ingroup  -ind=individuals.json -vcf=*.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=obs -outgroup=outgroup.txt -ancestral=homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_*.fa

(took 20 min) > hmmix create_ingroup  -ind=HG00096,HG00097 -vcf=*.bcf -weights=strickmask.bed -out=obs -outgroup=outgroup.txt -ancestral=homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/homo_sapiens_ancestor_*.fa
```
Now for training the HMM parameters and decoding
```bash
(took 3 min) > hmmix train  -obs=obs.HG00096.txt -weights=strickmask.bed -mutrates=mutationrate.bed -out=trained.HG00096.json

It is also possible to tell the model that the data is phased with the -haploid parameter. Below I am only showing the archaic segments.
```bash
(took 30 sec) > hmmix decode -obs=obs.HG00096.txt -weights=strickmask.bed -mutrates=mutationrate.bed -param=trained.HG00096.json -haploid

chrom      start          end       length   state    snps    mean_prob
1_hap1     3425000        3451000   27000    Archaic  22      0.95503

1_hap2     4304000        4336000    33000   Archaic  12      0.91395
1_hap2     4500000        4509000    10000   Archaic  7       0.83233
```

The first Archaic segment with a high mean posterior probability is from 3,425,000 to 3,450,000. And this segment has also been found be other methods:

```bash
# Conditional random field (S. Sankararaman - 2014)
chr1     3,421,722-3,450,286 HG00096
# Sstar (B. Vernot - 2016)
chr1     3,427,298-3,461,813 HG00096
# Sprime (S. Browning - 2018)
chr1     3,418,794-3,457,377 HG00096
# HMM (L. Skov 2018)
chr1     3,425,000-3,450,000 HG00096
```

And that is it! Now you have run the model and gotten a set of parameters that you can interpret biologically (see my paper) and you have a list of segments that belong to the human and Archaic state.

If you have any questions about the use of the scripts, if you find errors or if you have feedback you can contact my here (make an issue) or write to:

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

Install your package and its dependancies by using::

    pip install -e .

Development
-----------

For developing the package, you'll want to install the pre-commit hooks as well. Type::

    pre-commit install


Note that from now on when you commit, `black` will check your code for styling
errors. If it finds any it will correct them, but the commit will be aborted.
This is so that you can check its work before you continue. If you're happy,
just commit again.

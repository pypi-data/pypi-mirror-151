"""This module provides basic operations for constructing node graphs.

It supports the following operations:

1. feedforward connection: ">>", ">>="
2. feedback connection: "<<", "<<="
3. merge two nodes: "&", "&="
4. select subsets of one node: "[:]"
5. concatenate a sequence of nodes: "[node1, node2, ...]", "(node1, node2, ...)"
6. wrap a set of nodes: "{node1, node2, ...}"

However, all operations should satisfy the following assumptions:

1. Feedback connection of `(node1, node2)` should have a feedforward path from `node2` to `node1`.
2. Feedforward or feedback connections cannot generate a cycle.
3. Cannot concatenate multiple receiver nodes, e.g., `a >> [b, c]` is forbidden, but `a >> {b, c}`
   is allowed.

  a :py:class:`brainpy.nn.base.Network` instance. `senders` output will be used as
  input for `receivers` in the created network. This is similar to a
  function composition operation:

  .. math::

  You can also perform this operation using the ``>>`` operator::

  Or using this function::

      network = ff_connect(sender, receiver)

  - `sender` and `receiver` can also be :py:class:`brainpy.nn.base.Network` instances. In this
    case, the new :py:class:`brainpy.nn.base.Network` created will contain all nodes previously
    contained in all the networks, and link all `node1` outputs to all `node2`
    inputs. This allows to chain the  ``>>`` operator::

      step1 = node0 >> node1  # this is a network
      step2 = step1 >> node2  # this is another

  - `node1` can finally be lists or tuples of nodes. In this
    case, all `node1` outputs will be linked to a :py:class:`~.Concat` node to
    concatenate them, and the :py:class:`~.Concat` node will be linked to all
    `node2` inputs::

      # many-concat-to-one
      network = [node1, node2, ..., node] >> node_out

  - If you do not want to concatenate all input nodes, you can use `set` to
    wrap all input nodes at once. Then, `node2` will receive multiple inputs
    defined in `node1`::

      # many-to-one
      network = {node1, node2, ..., node_N} >> node_out

  - In the case of "one-to-many" feedforward connection, `node2` only support
    a set of node. Using list or tuple to wrap multiple receivers will concatenate
    all nodes in the receiver end. This will cause errors::

      network = node_in >> {node1, node2, ..., node_N}

      # correct operation of one-to-many
      network = node_in >> {node1, node2, ..., node_N}

  - "many-to-many" connection is also allowed.

    You can still use the ``>>`` operator in this situation,
    except for many-to-many nodes connections::

      # many-to-many
      {node1, node2, ..., node} >> {node1, node2, ..., node}

  Parameters
  ----------
  senders, receivers : Node, sequence of Node
    Nodes or sequence of nodes to connect feedforward connections.
  inplace: bool

  Notes
  -----

  Be careful to how you link the different nodes: `reservoirpy` does not
  allow to have circular dependencies between them::

      network = node1 >> node2  # fine
      network = node1 >> node2 >> node1  # raises! data would flow in
                                       # circles forever...

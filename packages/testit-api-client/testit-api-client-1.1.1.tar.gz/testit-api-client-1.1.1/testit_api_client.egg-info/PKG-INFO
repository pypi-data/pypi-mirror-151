Description: # Test IT TMS API client for Python
        ![Test IT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testit-tms/api-client-python/master/images/banner.png)
        
        # Getting Started
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install testit-api-client
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Configuration
        
        To use client you need to provide configuration to `Api`:
        ```py
        from testit_api_client.api import Api
        
        requests = Api(url, private_token, proxy=proxy)
        ```
        
        After configuration is done you can access different clients from `Api` object and then use methods to control Test IT.
        
        ## Examples
        
        ### Create and start test-run
        ```py
        from testit_api_client.json_fixture import JSONFixture
        
        testrun_id = requests.create_testrun(
                        JSONFixture.create_testrun(
                            project_id,
                            testrun_name))
        					
        requests.testrun_activity(testrun_id, 'start')
        ```
        
        ### Create autotest
        ```py
        autotest_id = requests.create_autotest(
        				JSONFixture.create_autotest(
        					external_id,
        					project_id,
        					autotest_name,
        					steps,
        					setup,
        					teardown,
        					namespace,
        					classname,
        					title,
        					description,
        					links,
        					labels
        				))		
        ```

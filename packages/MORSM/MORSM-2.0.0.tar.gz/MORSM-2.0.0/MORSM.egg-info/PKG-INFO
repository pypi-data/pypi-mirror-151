# MOR-SM
:aquarius: Moment-rate ORriented Slip Model, enables control on earthquakes moment rate timing, as seen from inversions word-wide :part_alternation_mark: 

### What is MOR-SM?

MOR-SM is moment-rate oriented slip model (kinematic approach), for seismic wave propagation simulation software - SW4 [^1].
The code contains a collection of a few command-line tools for manipulating slip function, time function and 
source time function, using source physical properties.

General code steps:

 1. Defining the segment's dimensions (width, length and slip) by Goda et al. (2016) [^2] equations for the desired magnitude.
 2. Fitting location parameters for the slip and time functions based on the desired diractivity.
 3. Computing the sliding time (Tr) from stage I and stage II for velocity I and velocity II respectively. 
 4. The features above are distributed by the time and slip function on each pixel on the segment.
 5. Generating Source Time Function (STF) for the earthquake you have just set.
 6. Compare your earthquake model to world-wide :earth_africa: inversions, SCARDEC database (Valle et al. 2011) [^3].
 7. Save your file as SW4 input.

### Installation

     pip install MORSM

or 

     git clone https://github.com/ABlaer/MOR-SM.git

in the command line:
     
1. navigate to Vall2021 directory and extracte SCARDEC:

          $  tar -xf  sourcefunction_archive_all.tar
2. move the database up one directory:

         $  mv ALL_MOY_and_OPTI_2021_MAJ_till_31122020/* .
     
  
### Dependencies

                [--slip | --no-slip] [--database | --no-database] [--stf | --no-stf]

           Moment-rate ORriented Slip Model, enables control on 
           earthquakes moment rate timing, as seen from inversions word-wide
        

    options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -v, --verbose         verbose - print log messages to screen?
        -l {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}, --log_level {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
            Log level (Default: DEBUG). see Python's Logging module for more details
        --logfile log file name     log to file
        -p parameter-file, --paramfile parameter-file
        -o output-file, --outfile output-file       Output SW4 source commands file (see Chapter 11.2 in SW4 manual)
        --slip, --no-slip     shows nice slip model to have (default: False)
        --database, --no-database     depicts SCARDERC database and MORSM event on it (default: False)
        --stf, --no-stf     shows accumulated seismic moment and source time function (STF) (default: False)

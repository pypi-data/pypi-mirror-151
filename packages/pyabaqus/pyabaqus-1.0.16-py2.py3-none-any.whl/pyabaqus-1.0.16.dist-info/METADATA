 Type hints for Abaqus/Python scripting

`pyabaqus` is a Python package providing type hints for Python scripting of Abaqus, you can 
use it to write your Python script of Abaqus fluently, even without doing anything in Abaqus. 
It also provides some simple APIs to execute the Abaqus commands so that you can run your 
Python script to build the model, submit the job and extract the output data in just one 
Python script, even without opening the Abaqus/CAE.

## New Features

- **Jupyter Notebook support (Since V1.0.15)**
  
  You can put your Abaqus/Python script into a Jupyter Notebook.
  When you run the notebook, the package will transfer the notebook into a plain Python file 
  with the same name but with `.py` suffix instead of `.ipynb`, and then it will be submitted 
  to Abaqus kernel. 
 
  In order to use this feature, you have to install the following packages:
  ```shell
  pip install ipyparams  # to read the file name of the notebook
  pip install notebook
  pip install jupyterlab
  ```
  Or use `conda` to install (the `ipyparams` package is only distributed in `PyPI`, 
  so you have to install it using `pip`):
  ```shell
  conda install jupyterlab
  conda install jupyter notebook
  ```
  
  Try the following command to make sure the `jupyter` command is available. 
  ```shell
  jupyter --version
  ```

## Installation

`pyabaqus` is using type hints features that require Python 3.9 or a later version, 
please upgrade it to Python 3.9 or a later version if you are using an earlier version.

`pyabaqus` is uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyabaqus), you can simply install 
it using pip:
```shell
pip install pyabaqus
```

`pyabaqus` is also uploaded to [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/haiiliin/pyabaqus), you can use 
`conda` to install it, since pyabaqus (from V1.0.15) depends on `ipyparams` and it is not distributed to 
anaconda, you have to use `pip` to install it manually:
```shell
pip install ipyparams
conda install -c haiiliin pyabaqus
```

You may install the latest development version by cloning the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Haiiliin/pyabaqus) and use `python` to install from 
the local directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Haiiliin/pyabaqus.git
cd pyabaqus
pip install ipyparams
python setup.py install
```

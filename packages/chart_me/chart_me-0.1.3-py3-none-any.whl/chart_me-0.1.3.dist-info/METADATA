# _Chart Me_ Charting that keeps you in the EDA flow

---

Chart Me is a high level charting library designed to expedite the Exploratory Data Analyis Process. There's a few automated eda tools like [sweet viz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) that give a great initial set of visualizations. [lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) is a great tool to leverage - which gives a feel of AI assistance - but not always on the mark. The other alternative is hand-writing Altair code, which takes me out of the EDA flow looking up syntax or building functions..._Chart Me_ serves to keep you in the data analytics flow of discovery by keeping visualization commands to **one function** to remember.

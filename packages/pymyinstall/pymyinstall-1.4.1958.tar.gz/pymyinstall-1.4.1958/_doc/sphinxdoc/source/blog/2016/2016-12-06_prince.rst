    My students were struggling to find a module which
    implements `MCA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_correspondence_analysis>`_
    (or `ACM <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyse_des_correspondances_multiples>`_ in French).
    The module they first found was not really accurate
    `mca <https://github.com/esafak/mca>`_. Bad sign, no update in two years.
    So they found `prince <https://github.com/MaxHalford/Prince>`_,
    recenly updated and nice graphs.
    Don't forget to read the first question from
    `FAQ <http://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#faq>`_.

    I tried to run the command ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``
    but it failed with the following error message::

        Checking .pth file support in build\bdist.win-amd64\wheel\CVXcanon-0.0.18.data\..\
        c:\Python34_x64\pythonw.exe -E -c pass
        TEST FAILED: build\bdist.win-amd64\wheel\CVXcanon-0.0.18.data\..\ does NOT support .pth files
        error: bad install directory or PYTHONPATH

        You are attempting to install a package to a directory that is not
        on PYTHONPATH and which Python does not read ".pth" files from.  The
        installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
        the distutils default setting) was:

            build\bdist.win-amd64\wheel\CVXcanon-0.0.18.data\..\

    So before giving up, I tried ``python setup.py install``
    which worked... So I decided the build a very simple
    wheel with the compiled files extracted from the
    ``site-packages`` directory.

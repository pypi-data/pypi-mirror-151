    :title: I tried to build pywin32 for Python 3.5

    So I installed
    `Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 <https://www.visualstudio.com/fr-fr/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx>`_,
    `Windows SDK <https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk>`_.
    I think some files changed positions so I played a little bit. I created folder
    ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\custom`` where I copied
    ``Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um`` into ``custom\include``
    and ``Windows Kits\8.1\Lib\winv6.3\um\x64`` into ``custom\lib``.
    I modified the file ``setup.py`` from pywin32 and
    I tried to build (``python setup.py build``).
    I ended up with this error::

        win32/src/win32wnet/PyNetresource.cpp(120): error C2440: 'initialisation': unable to convert from 'int (__cdecl *)(PyObject *,PyObject *)' to 'PyAsyncMethods *'

    Which will probably disappear in a couple of months when the code is updated
    but I'm still curious about what went wrong.

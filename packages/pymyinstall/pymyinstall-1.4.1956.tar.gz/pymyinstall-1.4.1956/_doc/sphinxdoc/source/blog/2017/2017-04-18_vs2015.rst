    Visual Studio Community Edition has updated to 2017
    and the link to kind the 2015 version is somehow difficult to find.
    It is not like I prefer 2015 but I need it to compile
    many Python module:
    `Visual Studio Community 2015 <https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/Catalog/Product/101>`_
    or this other link
    `Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 3 <https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%20community%202015>`_.

    I'm still trying to get a proper distribution of Python 3.5 on Windows.
    I had a couple of issues so far. Most of them come from
    some DLL which cannot be found.

    `pyzmq <https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq>`_.
    The version I got from
    `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyzmq>`_
    did not work and I had to install the
    `PyPi version <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq>`_ which
    proposes versions for Windows.

    `pywin32 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiwin32>`_
    is now available from
    `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiwin32>`_.
    Some DLLs might have to be copied
    from
    ``C:\Python35_x64\Lib\site-packages\pywin32_system32``
    to ``C:\Python35_x64`` unless the first path is added to ``PATH``.
    I don't do that because I have multiple versions of Python on the same machine.

    Some parts of matplotlib are still failing due to some issues
    with DLLs. The following instructions fails::

        import matplotlib.colorbar

    I tried to follow some solutions from *stackoverflow* but it still fails for me.
    One link `http://prod.openclassrooms.com/forum/sujet/matplotlib-sous-windows <http://prod.openclassrooms.com/forum/sujet/matplotlib-sous-windows>`_.
    However, this error happened with version 1.4, it does not happen
    with matplotlib **1.5**.

    Here is the list of packages not available yet (in a compiled version)
    on Python 3.5::

        aiohttp*
        cchardet*
        cgal_bindings
        dynd*
        gevent*
        grequests*
        la*
        libpython
        llvmpy
        mysqlclient*
        opencv_python*
        PuLP*
        py2exe
        pycrypto*
        pycurl*
        PySide
        pygit2*
        rpy2*
        tifffile*

    `scandir <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir>`_ is now
    part of the distribution.

    **2016/03/12** changes, some packages are now available on Python 3.5 (marked with ``*``),
    modules were disabled with::

        ModuleInstall(...) if sys.version_info[:2] <= (3, 4) else None

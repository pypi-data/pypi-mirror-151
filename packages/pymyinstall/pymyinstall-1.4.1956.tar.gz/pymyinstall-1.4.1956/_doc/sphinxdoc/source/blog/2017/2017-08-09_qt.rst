    I recently faced the issue:

    ::

        This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows"
        in "".

    The failing instruction:

    ::

        import matplotlib.plt

    Quite annoying. I finally found this page
    `Qt 5.1.1: Application failed to start because platform plugin "windows" is missing <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20495620/qt-5-1-1-application-failed-to-start-because-platform-plugin-windows-is-missi>`_
    which tells to set up ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH`` ot find DLL
    ``qwindows.dll``:

    ::

        set QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=%PYTHON%\Library\plugins\platforms

    Quite annoying.
    I was using Anaconda 3.5.

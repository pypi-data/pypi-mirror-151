    `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_
    is now available on Windows. You can find it
    on `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.
    It is compiled for GPU (NVIDIA only) and CPU.
    It is a dependency required for
    `edward <http://edwardlib.org/>`_ which seems to be a new and interesting package
    for Bayesian statistics. The documentation is really nice.

    `dlib <http://dlib.net/python/>`_ is a library for image processing.
    It is implemented in C++ but there is a Python wrapper.
    This is how you build it on Windows. First,
    install:

    * `boost <http://www.boost.org/>`_
    * `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_

    You need to build boost with your own interpreter.
    For that, you need to create a file ``user-config.jam``
    in ``c:\users\<username>`` which contains. Just replace
    the path by yours:

    ::

        using python
            : 3.5                   # Version
            : C:\\Python35_x64\\python.exe      # Python Path
            : C:\\Python35_x64\\include         # include path
            : C:\\Python35_x64\\libs            # lib path(s)
            :
            ;

    To build `boost <http://www.boost.org/>`_, two steps are neded from a command line
    where it was installed (sources)

    ::

        bootstrap
        b2 -a --with-python address-model=64 toolset=msvc runtime-link=static --debug-configuration

    The flag ``--debug-configuration`` allows to check the right Python was used.
    After `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_ is isntalled,
    we can build dlib with the sources obtained from pypi.

    ::

        set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\CMake\bin
        set BOOST_ROOT=C:\atools\local\boost_1_61_0
        set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\atools\local\boost_1_61_0\stage\lib

    And finally:

    ::

        c:\Python35_x64\python setup.py bdist_wheel

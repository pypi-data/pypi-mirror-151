        eggplant is a tool that transfers information from multiple different spatial
        transcriptomics data sets to a single reference representing a common
        coordinate framework (CCF).
        
        The package is compatible with `scanpy` and its derivatives as well as with
        `anndata`.
        
        We refer to the
        [Documentation](https://spatial-eggplant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eggplant.html#)
        for more information about installation and examples of use. You can also visit
        the [github](https://github.com/almaan/eggplant) page to find instructions on
        how to access example data sets and the associated manuscript.

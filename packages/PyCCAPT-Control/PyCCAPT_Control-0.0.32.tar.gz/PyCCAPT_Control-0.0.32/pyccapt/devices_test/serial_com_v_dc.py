 # @brief Example program to send commands using a COM Port.
 #
 # @details How to use this example:
 #  - Use this link to set up Visual Studio Code for Python:
 #    https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial
 #  - Use information provided by this link to install pySerial library
 #  - Run this Python script
 #  - Program shows you available COM ports
 #  - Choose the port you want to send commands to
 #  - Example command ">S0 10.00"
 #  - Device responds "#0 >S0:1.000000E+1"
 #  - Example command ">S0?"
 #  - Device responds "#1 >S0:0.000000E+00"
 #  - Type "exit" to exit the program
 #
 # @note This is just an example to show how to create a connection. Be aware
 # that This is not production ready code!

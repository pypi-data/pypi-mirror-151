Description: # DevDeck - macOS
        ![CI](https://github.com/marcus-crane/devdeck-macos/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)
        
        > A drop-in replacement for operating system controls and decks implemented in [DevDeck](https://github.com/jamesridgway/devdeck).
        
        DevDeck is a really neat tool but some of the default controls such as the volume controls assume you are running on a machine with [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) ie; Linux.
        
        This package is intended as a replacement for those controls but with support for macOS instead.
        
        More specifically, it uses `osascript` to issue system commands under the hood.
        
        By drop-in, you should only have to change the package name in the original DevDeck controls to achieve the same effect for macOS eg;
        
        ```diff
        decks:
          - serial_number: "ABC123456789"
            name: 'devdeck.decks.single_page_deck_controller.SinglePageDeckController'
            settings:
              controls:
        -       - name: 'devdeck.controls.volume_mute_control.VolumeMuteControl'
        +       - name: 'devdeck_macos.controls.volume_mute_control.VolumeMuteControl'
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        Simply install *DevDeck - macOS* into the same python environment that you have installed DevDeck.
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install devdeck-macos
        ```
        
        You can then update your DevDeck configuration to use decks and controls from this package.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        At the moment, only `VolumeMuteControl` is implemented but I plan to port over more controls shortly.
        
        Example configuration:
        
        ```yaml
        decks:
          - serial_number: "ABC123456789"
            name: 'devdeck.decks.single_page_deck_controller.SinglePageDeckController'
            settings:
              controls:
                - name: 'devdeck_macos.controls.volume_mute_control.VolumeMuteControl'
                  key: 0
        ```
        
        **NOTE**: Unlike the original package, you do not have to specify the specific microphone as it will default to the currently selected default in System Preferences.
        
        If there is a need for it, I can see whether osascript supports muting a specific input device.

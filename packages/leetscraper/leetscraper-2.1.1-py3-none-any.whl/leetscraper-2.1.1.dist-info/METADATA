leetscraper, a coding challenge webscraper for leetcode, and other websites!  
  
This scraper currently works for 
[leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com "leetcode website"), 
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net "projecteuler website"), 
[codechef.com](https://codechef.com "codechef website"), 
[hackerrank.com](https://hackerrank.com "hackerrank website"),
[codewars.com](https://codewars.com "codewars website").  
It was created as a way to gather coding problems to solve without having to sign up to a website or submit your code to a checker.

***

# Usage
  
### Install package

Installing leetscraper with pip will also install python dependencies needed. Chrome or Firefox are also required for this scraper to work.
```python
pip install leetscraper
```

### Examples

Import the module and Initialize the class. The class has some kwargs options to control the behaviour of the scraper.
However, all the default values will start to scrape all problems from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com "leetcode website") to the cwd.
  
The most basic usage looks like this:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Leetscraper()
```

The avaliable kwargs to control the behaviour of the scraper are:
```python
"""
website_name: name of a supported website to scrape ("leetcode.com" set if ignored)
scrape_path: "path/to/save/scraped_problems" (Current working directory set if ignored)
scrape_limit: Integer of how many problems to scrape at a time (no limit set if ignored)
auto_scrape: "True", "False" (True set if ignored)
"""
```

Example of how to automatically scrape the first 50 problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net "project euler website") to a directory called SOLVE-ME:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Leetscraper(website_name="projecteuler.net", scrape_path="~/SOLVE-ME", scrape_limit=50)
```

Example of how to scrape all problems from all supported websites:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    websites = [
        "leetcode.com",
        "projecteuler.net",
        "codechef.com",
        "hackerrank.com",
        "codewars.com",
    ]
    for site in websites:
        Leetscraper(website_name=site)
```

Example of how to manually scrape 3 specific problems from leetcode.com:
```python
from leetscraper import Leetscraper

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scraper = Leetscraper(
        website_name="leetcode.com",
        auto_scrape=False,
    )
    scraper.driver, scraper.get_problems = scraper.setup_scraper()
    scraper.get_problems = [
        ["number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence", 2],
        ["partition-equal-subset-sum", 2],
        ["minimum-possible-integer-after-at-most-k-adjacent-swaps-on-digits", 3],
    ]
    scraper.scraped = scraper.start_scraping()
```

### Information

How fast and reliable this scraper performs will change depending on things like which website you are scraping and your internet connection. 
There is also no guarantee that as these websites add new problems, that they will use the same class names in their html tags. Expect things 
to break and for some requests to fail. leetscraper.log will contain urls of failed scrapes if you wish to grab these manually, or run the scraper
again and see if the failures were just timeouts or dropped requests. Your mileage absolutely WILL vary, but as a rough point of reference of what you can expect, here is the results of a complete and unlimited test scrape.

```

You can pass through different arguments for different websites to control exactly how the scraper behaves.
You can also disable scraping problems at time of instantiation by using the kwarg `auto_scrape=False`.
This allows you to call the class functions in different order, or one at a time.
This will change how the scraper works, as its designed to look in a directory for already scraped problems to avoid duplicates.
This scraper was built with automation in mind. Run the script and forget, and come back to scraped coding problems.
I would encourage you to look at the function docstrings if you wish to use this scraper outside of its intended automated use.

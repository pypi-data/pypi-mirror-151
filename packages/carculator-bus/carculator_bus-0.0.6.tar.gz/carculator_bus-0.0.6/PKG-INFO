Prospective environmental and economic life cycle assessment of urban and coach buses.

A fully parameterized Python model developed by the [Technology Assessment group](https://www.psi.ch/en/ta) of the
[Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en) to perform life cycle assessments (LCA) of urban and coach buses.
Based on the Life Cycle Assessment tool for passenger vehicles [carculator](https://github.com/romainsacchi/carculator).

See [the documentation](https://carculator_bus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more detail, validation, etc.

The model has been the subject of a submission to the journal <i>Environmental Science and Technology</i>.
You may find a preprint version <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/ta/preprint" target="_blank">here<a/>.


## How to install?

For the latest version, using conda::

    conda install -c romainsacchi carculator_bus
    
or for a stable release, from Pypi::

    pip install carculator_bus
    
    
No extensive documentation right now, but check out the examples notebook.

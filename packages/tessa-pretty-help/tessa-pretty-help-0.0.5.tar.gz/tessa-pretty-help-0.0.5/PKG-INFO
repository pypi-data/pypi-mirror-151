        # tessa-pretty-help
        ## A fork of discord-pretty-help , Revised by prakarsh17
        
        An embed version of the built in help command for discord.py and probably other forks of discord.py ie Nextcord, Novus, pycord, etc.
        
        Inspired by the DefaultHelpCommand that discord.py uses, but revised for embeds and additional sorting on individual pages that can be "scrolled" through with reactions.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install tessa-pretty-help`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Example of how to use it:
        
        ```python
        from discord.ext import commands
        from pretty_help import PrettyHelp
        
        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", help_command=PrettyHelp())
        ```
        
        
        
        ### Added Optional Args
        
        - `color` - Set the default embed color
        - `ending_note` - Set the footer of the embed. Ending notes are fed a `commands.Context` (`ctx`) and a `PrettyHelp` (`help`) instance for more advanced customization.
        - `index_title` - Set the index page name default is *"Categories"*
        - `menu` - set a custom menu for navigating pages. Uses a `pretty_help.PrettyMenu()` instance. Default is `pretty_help.DefaultMenu()`
        - `no_category` - Set the name of the page with commands not part of a category. Default is "*No Category*"
        - `sort_commands` - Sort commands and categories alphabetically
        - `show_index` - Show the index page or not
        
        ### pretty_help.DefaultHelp args
        
        - `active_time` - Set the time (in seconds) that the message will be active. Default is 30s
        - `delete_after_timeout` - Delete the message after `active_time` instead of removing reactions. Default `False`
        - `page_left` - The emoji to use to page left
        - `page_right` - The emoji to use to page right
        - `remove` - The emoji to use to remove the help message
        
        
        By default, the help will just pick a random color on every invoke. You can change this using the `color` argument:
        
        ```python
        
        from discord.ext import commands
        from pretty_help import DefaultMenu, PrettyHelp
        
        # ":discord:743511195197374563" is a custom discord emoji format. Adjust to match your own custom emoji.
        menu = DefaultMenu(page_left="\U0001F44D", page_right="👎", remove=":discord:743511195197374563", active_time=5)
        
        # Custom ending note
        ending_note = "The ending note from {ctx.bot.user.name}\nFor command {help.clean_prefix}{help.invoked_with}"
        
        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")
        
        bot.help_command = PrettyHelp(menu=menu, ending_note=ending_note)
        ```
        
        The basic `help` command will break commands up by cogs. Each cog will be a different page. Those pages can be navigated with
        the arrow embeds. The message is unresponsive after 30s of no activity, it'll remove the reactions to let you know.

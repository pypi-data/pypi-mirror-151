        You can see trusted packages under the [pakages](https://github.com/pakages) organization. Trusted means
        that they are built, tested, and deployed from modular repositories, and can be
        installed into consistent container bases that Pakages provides.
        
        ## Goals
        
        We want a framework that is optimized to help people build packages from source,
        and distribute the binaries via GitHub packages and also provide robust metadata
        and an organization scheme that works well for containers. We want a focus on that
        and then testing and automatically updating the individual packages provided.
        Pakages provides this functionality by wrapping spack to perform builds, and then
        providing tooling to release to a GitHub packages build cache, and to run base
        containers that will reliably hit the cache.

# Unique-function Package
To install the function you need to execute a command:

"pip install unique-function"

this package is able to identify the unique characters of the transmitted line and text from the file.

To define unique characters, run python and import the package:

"from unique_package import unique_function"
"unique_function.unique_symbols("your text")"

when executing two commands, the --file has higher priority

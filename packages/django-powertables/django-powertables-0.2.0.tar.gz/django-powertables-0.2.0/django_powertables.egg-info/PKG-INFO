        ## About
        
        Destacks Powertables is a sortable filter table implementation for the Django web
        framework.
        
        ## Project State
        
        This project is in the early stages and might be subject to breaking changes until it
        reaches its 1.0-release.
        
        ## License
        
        This project is licensed under dual Free Software (AGPL v3+) and commercial license. If
        you want to obtain a commercial license, please write to: info@destacks.com
        
        If you want to read the AGPL license text, please look at the file `LICENSE.AGPL.txt` in
        the root folder of this project.
        
        ## Versions
        
        The source code in the Free Software AGPL v3+ and commercial license is the same and
        does not differ concerning its features. Just the licensing is different; this will
        never change.
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Install the app from PyPI:
        
           ```bash
           pip install django-powertables
           ```
        
        2. Add the `powertables` app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
        
           ```python
           INSTALLED_APPS = [
               # ...
               "powertables",
           ]
           ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Please look at the example project in the `example` folder on how to use this project.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        If you contribute to this project, you agree that we have the right to license your
        contribution under the AGPL v3+, a commercial license, and eventually later release it
        into the public domain.
        
        ## Supporting the Community
        
        Five percent of all gross revenue of this project will be donated to the Django Software
        Foundation (later, we might add more projects and organizations).
        
        ## Future-Proofing
        
        If this project reaches its EOL and will not be continued in any other form (that keeps
        the intent of the terms in this readme), we will release all source code into the public
        domain.
        
        ## Changes
        
        We might adjust or clarify some text concerning the terms of this project, but only
        under the condition that the original intent is kept.
        
        ## Merging of Code
        
        This project might be merged with other projects by us in the future, but only if the
        conditions of the above sections are kept in the merged project.
        
        ## Extraction of Code
        
        Parts of this project might be extracted and used in other projects by us in the future,
        but only if the conditions of the above sections are kept in the other projects.
        
        ## Affiliation (or lack thereof)
        
        This project is independent and not endorsed by or affiliated with the Django Software
        Foundation. Django is a registered trademark of the Django Software Foundation.
        
        ## Outlook
        
        Destacks Powertables might be extended to be used with other frameworks and programming
        languages in the future.

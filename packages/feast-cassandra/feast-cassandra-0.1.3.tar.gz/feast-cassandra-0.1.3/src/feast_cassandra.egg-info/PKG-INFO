Description: # Feast Cassandra / Astra DB online store plugin
        
        A [Feast](https://feast.dev/)
        plugin to use
        [Apache Cassandraâ„¢](https://cassandra.apache.org) / 
        [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com/) as online store.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the plugin alongside Feast with:
        
        ```
        pip install feast-cassandra
        ```
        
        ## Quick usage
        
        Once the package is installed, switching online store to Cassandra / Astra DB
        is a matter of altering the `online_store` key in `feature_store.yaml`.
        
        With reference to the [Feast quickstart](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart),
        the minimal steps are:
        
        1. (assuming both `feast` and this plugin are installed)
        2. creating a feature repository, `feast init feature_repo`;
        3. `cd feature_repo`;
        4. editing the `feature_store.yaml` as detailed below;
        5. all subsequent steps proceed as usual.
        
        ### Cassandra setup
        
        The only required settings are `hosts` and `type`. The port number
        is to be provided only if different than the default (9042),
        and username/password only if the database requires authentication.
        
        ```yaml
        [...]
        online_store:
            type: feast_cassandra_online_store.cassandra_online_store.CassandraOnlineStore
            hosts:
                - 192.168.1.1
                - 192.168.1.2
                - 192.168.1.3
            keyspace: KeyspaceName
            port: 9042        # optional
            username: user    # optional
            password: secret  # optional
        ```
        
        ### Astra DB setup:
        
        To point Feast to using an Astra DB instance as online store, an 
        [Astra DB token](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure)
        with "Database Administrator" role is required: provide the Client ID and
        Client Secret in the token as username and password.
        
        The 
        ["secure connect bundle"](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/download-scb/#c-procedure)
        for connecting to the database is also needed:
        its full path must be given in the configuration below:
        
        ```yaml
        [...]
        online_store:
            type: feast_cassandra_online_store.cassandra_online_store.CassandraOnlineStore
            secure_bundle_path: /path/to/secure/bundle.zip
            keyspace: KeyspaceName
            username: Client_ID
            password: Client_Secret
        ```
        
        ### More info
        
        For a more detailed walkthrough, please see the
        [Awesome Astra](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/tools/integration/feast/)
        page on the Feast integration.
        
        ## Features
        
        The plugin leverages the architecture of Cassandra for optimal performance:
        
        - table partitioning tailored to data access pattern;
        - prepared statements.
        
        #### Credits
        
        The author of this plugin acknowledges prior exploratory work by
        [`hamzakpt`](https://github.com/hamzakpt) and Brian Mortimore,
        on which this implementation is loosely based.

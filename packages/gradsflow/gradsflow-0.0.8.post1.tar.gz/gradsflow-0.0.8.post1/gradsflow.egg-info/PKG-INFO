## About GradsFlow

!!! attention
    ðŸš¨ GradsFlow is changing fast. There will be a lot of breaking changes until we reach `0.1.0`.
    Feel free to give your feedback by creating an issue or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gradsflow/shared_invite/zt-ulc0m0ef-xstzyowuTgYceVmFbJlBmg) group.

GradsFlow is an open-source AutoML Library based on PyTorch.
Our goal is to democratize AI and make it available to everyone.

It can automatically build & train Deep Learning Models for different tasks on your laptop or to a remote cluster
directly from your laptop.
It provides a powerful and easy-to-extend [Model Training API](https://docs.gradsflow.com/en/latest/gradsflow/models/model/)
that can be used to train almost any PyTorch model.
Though GradsFlow has its own Model Training API it also supports [PyTorch Lightning Flash](https://lightning-flash.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
to provide more rich features across different tasks.


!!! info
    Gradsflow is built for both *beginners* and *experts*! `AutoTasks` provides zero-code AutoML while
    `Model` and `Tuner` provides custom model training and Hyperparameter optimization.


### Installation

**Recommended**:

The recommended method of installing `gradsflow` is either with `pip` from PyPI or, with `conda` from conda-forge channel.

- **with pip**

  ```sh
  pip install -U gradsflow
  ```

- **with conda**

  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge gradsflow
  ```

**Latest** (unstable):

You can also install the latest bleeding edge version (could be unstable) of `gradsflow`, should you feel motivated enough, as follows:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/gradsflow/gradsflow@main
```

### Automatic Model Building and Training
Are you a beginner or from non Machine Learning background? This section is for you. Gradsflow `AutoTask` provides
automatic model building and training across various different tasks
including Image Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Text Summarization and more to come.

### Simplified Hyperparameter tuning API
`Tuner` provides a simplified API to move from Model Training to Hyperparameter optimization.

### Components

- `gradsflow.core`: [Core](https://docs.gradsflow.com/en/latest/gradsflow/core/) defines the building blocks
of AutoML tasks.

- `gradsflow.autotasks`: [AutoTasks](https://docs.gradsflow.com/en/latest/gradsflow/tasks/) defines
different ML/DL tasks which is provided by gradsflow AutoML API.

- `gradsflow.model`: GradsFlow [Model](https://docs.gradsflow.com/en/latest/gradsflow/models/model/) provides a simple and
  yet customizable Model Training API.
  You can train any PyTorch model using `model.fit(...)` and it is easily customizable for more complex tasks.

- `gradsflow.tuner`: [AutoModel](https://docs.gradsflow.com/en/latest/gradsflow/tuner/) HyperParameter search with minimal code changes.

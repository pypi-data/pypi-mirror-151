 Solace Python Framework
</h1>


Solace is a next generation web framework for Python3, inspired by Koa, built on Starlette.

## Goals

- make a framework that enables truly re-usable code
    - we have a concept of "flows" (lightweight middleware)
- make a framework that is easily extendable via plugins
    - Starlette provides a solid core, everything extra is handled via plugins

- provide a "common sense" approach to building web apps
- enable rapid development and deployment using best practices
- solve the problem first, then write the code

### Solace is made from Awesome Open Source Projects

- Starlette
- Typer
- Poetry
- Loguru
- python-dotenv
- Jinja2
- Arrow
- Cerberus

    The ViennaRNA Package consists of a C code library and several stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. It is developed and maintained by the Theoretical Biochemistry Group at the University of Vienna.

    In case you are using ViennaRNA software for your publications you may want to cite:

    Lorenz, Ronny and Bernhart, Stephan H. and HÃ¶ner zu Siederdissen, Christian and Tafer,
    Hakim and Flamm, Christoph and Stadler, Peter F. and Hofacker, Ivo L.
    ViennaRNA Package 2.0
    Algorithms for Molecular Biology, 6:1 26, 2011, doi:10.1186/1748-7188-6-26

    The PyPI installer is maintained by Ayaan Hossain, so that Python developers can
    specify ViennaRNA as a requirement for their applications, without needing their
    users to download and install it separately. Because this is the 21st century, and
    dependency installation should not deter application adoption.

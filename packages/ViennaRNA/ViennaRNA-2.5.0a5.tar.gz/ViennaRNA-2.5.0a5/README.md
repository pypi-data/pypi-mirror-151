### ViennaRNA

The [`ViennaRNA` Package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) consists of a **C** code library and several stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. It is developed and maintained by the [Theoretical Biochemistry Group](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/index.html) at the University of Vienna.

In case you are using `ViennaRNA` software for your publications you may want to cite:

### `ViennaRNA` PyPI Installation

Life at last is simple, and the possibilities are endless.

Just open your favorite shell.

```bash
$ pip install ViennaRNA
```

Sit back, relax and let `pip` do its thing. When everything is installed, verify like so.

```bash
$ python
Python 3.9.5 (default, Jun  4 2022, 12:28:51)
[GCC 7.5.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ViennaRNA
>>> dir(ViennaRNA)
['RNA', 'RNAlib', 'ViennaRNA', '__author__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__license__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__', '__spec__', '__version__', 'main', 'rna', 'rnalib', 'viennarna']
```

> **Note** The objects `RNA`, `RNAlib`, `ViennaRNA`, `rna`, `rnalib`, and `viennarna` all refer to the same `RNA` SWIG module that you'd get if you installed the ViennaRNA python interface from source. The statements `from ViennaRNA import RNA` is then equivalent to `from ViennaRNA import rnalib`.

### Using `ViennaRNA` from PyPI

The PyPI installer was developed so that computational synthetic biologists could specify `ViennaRNA` as a requirement for their `python` applications (via `install_requires` in their `setup.py`), without requiring their users to download and install it separately. Because this is the 21st century, and dependency installation should not deter application adoption. Once installed, you can seamlessly `import RNA`, successfully. Another reason this installer exists is because the `conda` package for `ViennaRNA` is broken, and hasn't been fixed in a while. This installer works under `conda` as well.

Relevant DNA or RNA parameter files will need to be packaged with developed application and supplied to `RNA.read_parameter_file(parameter_file_path)` for proper usage. You may then want to specify those parameter files as part of your `package_data` in your `setup.py`, and make it available to `RNA.read_parameter_file(...)` via `pkg_resource.resource_filename(...)` function.

You can find all of the different DNA and RNA parameters accepted by the `RNA` module in [here](https://github.com/ayaanhossain/ViennaRNA/tree/main/ViennaRNA-2.4.18-Latest/misc).

**Example:** Say, your application is called `awesomeRNA` and your package is structured like the following.

```
- awesomeRNA/
    - docs/
    - examples/
    - tests/
    - awesomeRNA/
        - __init__.py
        - awesomeRNA.py
        - utils.py
        - params/
            - dna_mathews2004.par
            - rna_andronescu2007.par
    - setup.py
    - setup.cfg
    - README.md
    - LICENSE
```

A part of your `setup` function inside `setup.py` may then contain the following.

```python
setup(

    # stuff before

    packages=['awesomeRNA', 'awesomeRNA.params'],

    package_dir={
        'awesomeRNA': './awesomeRNA'},

    package_data={
        'awesomeRNA': ['params/*.par']},

    install_requires=[
        'numpy',
        'ViennaRNA']

    # stuff after
)
```

Then in your application code, you can perhaps do the following.

```python
import RNA
import pkg_resources

def awesomeRNA_main(
    seqeuence,
    temperature=37,
    param_name='dna_matthews2004'):

    # Basic Setup
    if temperature != 37:
        RNA.cvar.temperature = temperature
    RNA.cvar.dangles = 2
    settings = RNA.md()

    # Read Parameters
    parameter_file = pkg_resources.resource_filename(
        'awesomeRNA', 'params/{}.par'.format(
            param_name))
    RNA.read_parameter_file(parameter_file)

    # Calculate MFE and Secondary Structure
    fc_obj = RNA.fold_compound(
        seqeuence,
        settings)
    structure, mfe = fc_obj.mfe()

    # Return Results
    return structure, mfe

```

### Troubleshooting

If you have trouble installing this package inside a `conda` environment due to `libgcc` issues, you might want to install `mamba` (`conda install -c conda-forge mamba`), or create your environment with `mamba` to begin with (`conda create -n myEnvName -c conda-forge mamba`). Then, simply `mamba install libgcc` and try `pip install ViennaRNA` again. Additionally, you might require to `mamba install libgcc-ng libstdcxx-ng`.

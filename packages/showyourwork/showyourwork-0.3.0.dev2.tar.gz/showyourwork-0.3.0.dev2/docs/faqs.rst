Permissions errors in GitHub Actions
------------------------------------

If you try to build a |showyourwork| article from a repository fork
on GitHub Actions, you may run into the following error when the action
attempts to push the results to the ``-pdf`` branch:

.. code-block:: text

    Uploading output
    /tmp/tmp.KORuhtnUA7
    Switched to a new branch 'main-pdf'
    [main-pdf (root-commit) 224ecfd] force-push article output
    2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 arxiv.tar.gz
    create mode 100644 ms.pdf
    remote: Permission to $USER/$REPO.git denied to github-actions[bot].
    fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/$USER/$REPO/': The requested URL returned error: 403

This happens because the default GitHub Actions permissions for the ``GITHUB_TOKEN``
secret are set to ``restricted`` for repository forks. To get the build to work,
go to

.. raw:: html

    <pre>
    https://github.com/<span class="text-highlight">$USER/$REPO</span>/settings/actions
    </pre>

and change the permissions to ``permissive``:

Debugging remote builds
-----------------------

Set ``CI=true`` environment variable to mimic the behavior on GitHub Actions locally.
More information on this soon.


Installing LaTeX
----------------

To install TeX for access in (say) Python scripts (e.g., for rendering LaTeX expressions
with ``matplotlib``), see 
`here <https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork/blob/f5a9332cb4b1d134bb2103fae2e2853da04fe501/showyourwork-action/src/tex.js>`__.

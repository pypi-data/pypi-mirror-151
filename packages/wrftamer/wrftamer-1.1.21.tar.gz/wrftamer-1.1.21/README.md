# WRFtamer
WRFtamer is a tool to organize WRF simulations. This includes organizing experiments into projects, creating simulations, running WPS, postprocessing data and archiving completed runs. This tool also provides an overview on how long a simulation runs and how much disk space it takes. 
The programm can be used from the command line and using a graphical user interface (GUI).
WRFtamer is designed to run WRF with em_real. Is is able to create sumbit-scripts for the cluster, but only for the SLURM job scheduler. 

## Requirements
This repository has been tested with python 3.7.12
### External python modules
See requirements.txt
 
## Installation
It can be installed using pip
```bash
pip install wrftamer
```

conda install -c os-simopt wrftamer
```

### Optional python modules
The Cartopy package is required to display maps of your data. If you want to use these features, you need to install this package manually.

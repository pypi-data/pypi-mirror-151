Welcome
=======

``celmech`` is a Python package containing a variety of numerical tools for celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy.
The package is designed to interface closely with the `REBOUND <https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ N-body integrator.


Getting Started!
----------------

``celmech`` is written in Python (with some C source code).  For instructions on installation, see :ref:`install`. 
You can then check out :ref:`first_example`. 
You may also want to check out the `Git repository <https://github.com/shadden/celmech/>`_ and its Jupyter notebook examples under celmech/ipython_examples.

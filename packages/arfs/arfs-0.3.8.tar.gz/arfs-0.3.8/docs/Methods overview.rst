Methods overview
================

Boruta
------

The Boruta algorithm tries to capture all the important features you might have in your dataset with respect to an outcome variable. The procedure is the following:

 * Create duplicate copies of all independent variables. When the number of independent variables in the original data is less than 5, create at least 5 copies using existing variables.
 * Shuffle the values of added duplicate copies to remove their correlations with the target variable. It is called shadow features or permuted copies.
 * Combine the original ones with shuffled copies
 * Run a random forest classifier on the combined dataset and performs a variable importance measure (the default is Mean Decrease Accuracy) to evaluate the importance of each variable where higher means more important.
 * Then Z score is computed. It means mean of accuracy loss divided by the standard deviation of accuracy loss.
 * Find the maximum Z score among shadow attributes (MZSA)
 * Tag the variables as 'unimportant' when they have importance significantly lower than MZSA. Then we permanently remove them from the process.
 * Tag the variables as 'important' when they have importance significantly higher than MZSA.
 * Repeat the above steps for a predefined number of iterations (random forest runs), or until all attributes are either tagged 'unimportant' or 'important', whichever comes first.

At every iteration, the algorithm compares the Z-scores of the shuffled copies of the features and the original features to see if the latter performed better than the former. If it does, the algorithm will mark the feature as important. In essence, the algorithm is trying to validate the importance of the feature by comparing with randomly shuffled copies, which increases the robustness. This is done by simply comparing the number of times a feature did better with the shadow features using a binomial distribution. Since the whole process is done on the same train-test split, the variance of the variable importance comes only from the different re-fit of the model over the different iterations.


BoostARoota
-----------

BoostARoota follows closely the Boruta method but modifies a few things:

 * One-Hot-Encode the feature set
 * Double width of the data set, making a copy of all features in the original dataset
 * Randomly shuffle the new features created in (2). These duplicated and shuffled features are referred to as "shadow features"
 * Run XGBoost classifier on the entire data set ten times. Running it ten times allows for random noise to be smoothed, resulting in more robust estimates of importance. The number of repeats is a parameter than can be changed.
 * Obtain importance values for each feature. This is a simple importance metric that sums up how many times the particular feature was split on in the XGBoost algorithm.
 * Compute "cutoff": the average feature importance value for all shadow features and divide by four. Shadow importance values are divided by four (parameter can be changed) to make it more difficult for the variables to be removed. With values lower than this, features are removed at too high of a rate.
 * Remove features with average importance across the ten iterations that is less than the cutoff specified in (6)
 * Go back to (2) until the number of features removed is less than ten per cent of the total.
 * Method returns the features remaining once completed.

In the spirit, the same heuristic than Boruta but using Boosting (originally Boruta was supporting only random forest). The validation of the importance is done by comparing to the maximum of the median var. imp of the shadow predictors (in Boruta, a statistical test is performed using the Z-score). Since the whole process is done on the same train-test split, the variance of the variable importance comes only from the different re-fit of the model over the different iterations.

 
Modifications to Boruta
 
**Boruta --> Leshy**:

For chronological dev, see https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py/pull/77 and https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py/pull/100

Leshy vs BorutaPy:
    To summarize, this PR solves/enhances:
     - The categorical features (they are detected, encoded. The tree-based models are working
       better with integer encoding rather than with OHE, which leads to deep and unstable trees).
       If Catboost is used, then the cat.pred (if any) are set up
     - Work with Catboost sklearn API
     - Allow using sample_weight, for applications like Poisson regression or any requiring weights
     - 3 different feature importances: native, SHAP and permutation. Native being the least consistent
       (because of the imp. biased towards numerical and large cardinality categorical)
       but the fastest of the 3.
     - Using lightGBM as default speed up by an order of magnitude the running time
     - Visualization like in the R package

BorutaPy vs Boruta R:
    The improvements of this implementation include:
    - Faster run times:
        Thanks to scikit-learn's fast implementation of the ensemble methods.
    - Scikit-learn like interface:
        Use BorutaPy just like any other scikit learner: fit, fit_transform and
        transform are all implemented in a similar fashion.
    - Modularity:
        Any ensemble method could be used: random forest, extra trees
        classifier, even gradient boosted trees.
    - Two step correction:
        The original Boruta code corrects for multiple testing in an overly
        conservative way. In this implementation, the Benjamini Hochberg FDR is
        used to correct in each iteration across active features. This means
        only those features are included in the correction which are still in
        the selection process. Following this, each that passed goes through a
        regular Bonferroni correction to check for the repeated testing over
        the iterations.
    - Percentile:
        Instead of using the max values of the shadow features the user can
        specify which percentile to use. This gives a finer control over this
        crucial parameter. For more info, please read about the perc parameter.
    - Automatic tree number:
        Setting the n_estimator to 'auto' will calculate the number of trees
        in each iteration based on the number of features under investigation.
        This way more trees are used when the training data has many features
        and less when most of the features have been rejected.
    - Ranking of features:
        After fitting BorutaPy it provides the user with ranking of features.
        Confirmed ones are 1, Tentatives are 2, and the rejected are ranked
        starting from 3, based on their feature importance history through
        the iterations.
    - Using either the native variable importance, scikit permutation importance,
        SHAP importance.

    We highly recommend using pruned trees with a depth between 3-7.
    For more, see the docs of these functions, and the examples below.

    Boruta is an all relevant feature selection method, while most other are
    minimal optimal; this means it tries to find all features carrying
    information usable for prediction, rather than finding a possibly compact
    subset of features on which some classifier has a minimal error.
    Why bother with all relevant feature selection?
    When you try to understand the phenomenon that made your data, you should
    care about all factors that contribute to it, not just the bluntest signs
    of it in context of your methodology (yes, minimal optimal set of features
    by definition depends on your classifier choice).

Process:
    - Loop over n_iter or until dec_reg == 0
    - add shadows
       o find features that are tentative
       o make sure that at least 5 columns are added
       o shuffle shadows
       o get feature importance
           * fit the estimator
           * extract feature importance (native, shap or permutation)
           * return feature importance
       o separate the importance of shadows and rea
    - Calculate the maximum shadow importance and append to the previous run
    - Assign hits using the imp_sha_max of this run
       o find all the feat imp > imp_sha_max
       o tag them as hits
       o add +1 to the previous tag vector
    - Perform a test
       o select non rejected features yet
       o get a binomial p-values (nbr of times the feat has been tagged as important
       on the n_iter done so far) o reject or not according the (corrected) p-val


Modifications to BoostARoota
----------------------------
**BoostARoota --> BoostAGroota**:

Original version of BoostARoota:
    One-Hot-Encode the feature set
    Double width of the data set, making a copy of all features in original dataset
    Randomly shuffle the new features created in (2). These duplicated and shuffled features
      are referred to as "shadow features"
    Run XGBoost classifier on the entire data set ten times. Running it ten times allows for
      random noise to be smoothed out, resulting in more robust estimates of importance.
      The number of repeats is a parameter than can be changed.
    * Obtain importance values for each feature. This is a simple importance metric that sums up
      how many times the particular feature was split on in the XGBoost algorithm.
    * Compute "cutoff": the average feature importance value for all shadow features and divide by a factor
      (parameter to deal with conservativeness). With values lower than this,
      features are removed at too high of a rate.
    * Remove features with average importance across the ten iterations that is less than
      the cutoff specified in (6)
    * Go back to (2) until the number of features removed is less than ten percent of the total.
    * Method returns the features remaining once completed.

Modifications:
    - Replace XGBoost with LightGBM, you can still use tree-based scikitlearn models
    - Replace native var.imp by SHAP var.imp. Indeed, the impurity var.imp. are biased and
      sensitive to large cardinality
      (see [scikit demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.
      html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-inspection-plot-permutation-importance-py)).
      Moreover, the native var. imp are computed on the train set, here the data are split (internally)
      in train and test, var. imp computed on the test set.
    - Handling categorical predictors. Cat. predictors should NOT be one hot encoded,
      it leads to deep unstable trees.
      Instead, it's better to use the native method of lightGBM or CatBoost.
      A preprocessing step is needed to encode
      (ligthGBM and CatBoost use integer encoding and reference to categorical columns.
      The splitting stratigies are different then, see official doc).
    - Work with sample_weight, for Poisson or any application requiring a weighting.
 
GrootCV, a new method
---------------------
 
**New: GrootCV**:
   - Cross-validated feature importance to smooth out the noise, based on lightGBM only (which is, most of the time, the fastest and more accurate Boosting).
   - the feature importance is derived using SHAP importance
   - Taking the max of median of the shadow var. imp over folds otherwise not enough conservative and it improves the convergence (needs less evaluation to find a threshold)
   - Not based on a given percentage of cols needed to be deleted
   - Plot method for var. imp

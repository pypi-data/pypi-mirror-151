updates:
* example page: add links to related examples.
* quickstart docs
* add rm docs?
* tests with live site?
* don't touch verbatim

explore:
- fix favico
- comments? link directly, and/or provide count?
- provide tools for reverse linking into external md documents (e.g. sourmash docs) - scanning docs, etc.

refinements -
- link to users with @
- github actions on sourmash examples?
- add README flair / pypi etc
- template repo - figure out how to refer to current repo in ribbity?

longer-term:
- consider references to content, e.g. issue: content is over <here>
- make templates directory location configurable

ribbity docs/examples to add:
- issue template example (and/or make a template repo?)
- adding your own page

ARGUMENTS for using github issues:
- forward and reverse links between issues
- linking between issues and PRs in different repositories
- robust commenting on issues
- good auth/moderation/contribution on github
- label API is nice
- markdown formatting is nice
- can use github editor for quick examples, hackmd for longer ones

- enables the "pull request hack" but with out PRs!
- viz utterances

Additional sourmash examples:
- creating conda environment
- limiting search results with include
- sig grep
- sig summarize

Ideas!!
- newsletters/weekly/dated
- building lesson plans out of foo

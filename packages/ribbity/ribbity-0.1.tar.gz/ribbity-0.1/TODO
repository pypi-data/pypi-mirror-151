updates:
* example page: add links to related examples.
* register project
* quickstart docs
* ignore this page (in indices? overall?)

explore:
- fix favico
- comments? link directly, and/or provide count?
- provide tools for reverse linking into external md documents (e.g. sourmash docs)

refinements -
- link to users with @
- github actions on sourmash examples?

longer-term:
- consider references to content, e.g. issue: content is over <here>

ARGUMENTS for using github issues:
- forward and reverse links between issues
- linking between issues and PRs in different repositories
- robust commenting on issues
- good auth/moderation/contribution on github
- label API is nice
- markdown formatting is nice
- can use github editor for quick examples, hackmd for longer ones

- enables the "pull request hack" but with out PRs!
- viz utterances

Additional examples:
- creating conda environment
- limiting search results with include
- sig grep
- sig summarize

Ideas!!
- newsletters/weekly/dated
- building lesson plans out of foo

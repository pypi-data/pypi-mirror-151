# cdk-amazon-chime-resources

![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/experimental-important.svg?style=for-the-badge)

An AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) construct library that allows you to provision Amazon Chime resources with npm and pypi

## Background

Amazon Chime resources (Phone numbers, SIP media applications, and Voice Connectors) are not natively available in AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK. Therefore, in order to create these resources with AWS CDK, an AWS Lambda backed custom resource must be used. In an effort to simplify that process, this AWS CDK construct has been created. This AWS CDK construct will create a custom resource and associated Lambda and expose constructs that can be used to create corresponding resources.

## Usage

See [example/lib/cdk-chime-resources-example.ts](example/lib/cdk-chime-resources-example.ts) for a complete example.

To add to your AWS CDK package.json file:

```
yarn add cdk-amazon-chime-resources
```

Within your AWS CDK:

### Phone Number Creation

```python
const phoneNumber = new chime.ChimePhoneNumber(this, 'phoneNumber', {
  phoneState: 'IL',
  phoneNumberType: chime.PhoneNumberType.LOCAL,
  phoneProductType: chime.PhoneProductType.SMA,
});
```

The phone number created will be a `LOCAL` number for use with `SMA` from a pool of available numbers in Illinois. Other search option are available that will return a single phone number based on the criteria provided.

### SIP Media Application Creation

```python
const sipMediaApp = new chime.ChimeSipMediaApp(this, 'sipMediaApp', {
  region: this.region,
  endpoint: smaHandler.functionArn,
});
```

The SIP media application created will use the smaHandler referenced by the endpoint in the same region the AWS CDK is being deployed in. The SIP media application must be created in the same region as the associated Lambda endpoint and must be in `us-east-1` or `us-west-2`.

### SIP Media Application Rule Creation

```python
const sipRule = new chime.ChimeSipRule(this, 'sipRule', {
  triggerType: chime.TriggerType.TO_PHONE_NUMBER,
  triggerValue: phoneNumber.phoneNumber,
  targetApplications: [
    {
      region: this.region,
      priority: 1,
      sipMediaApplicationId: sipMediaApp.sipMediaAppId,
    },
  ],
});
```

The SIP rule will assocaite the previously created phone number with the previously created SIP media application. The SIP rule can be associated with either an E.164 number or Amazon Chime Voice Connector URI. If the TriggerType is `TO_PHONE_NUMBER`, the TriggerValue must be an E.164 number. If the TriggerType is `REQUEST_URI_HOSTNAME`, the TriggerValue must be an Amazon Chime Voice Connector URI. A priority must be assigned with a value between 1 and 25 inclusive. A targetApplication is required. This will associate the trigger to the SIP media application and associated Lambda.

### Voice Connector Creation

Using a phone number created with Product Type of VC:

```python
const voiceConnector = new chime.ChimeVoiceConnector(this, 'voiceConnector', {
  encryption: true,
  name: 'string',
  region: 'us-east-1',
  termination: {
    terminationCidrs: ['198.51.100.10/32'],
    callingRegions: ['US'],
  },
  origination: [
    {
      host: '198.51.100.10',
      port: 5061,
      protocol: chime.Protocol.TCP,
      priority: 1,
      weight: 1,
    },
  ],
  streaming: {
    enabled: true,
    dataRetention: 0,
    notificationTargets: [chime.NotificationTargetType.EVENTBRIDGE],
  },
});
```

This will create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector with specified options. Termination, origination, and streaming are all optional.

```python
voiceConnectorPhone.associateWithVoiceConnector(voiceConnector);
```

This will assocaite the previously created phone number with the voice connector.

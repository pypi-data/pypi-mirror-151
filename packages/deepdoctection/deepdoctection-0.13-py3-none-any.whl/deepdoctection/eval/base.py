    Base class for metrics. Metrics only exist as classes and are not instantiated. They consist of two class variables:

        - A metric function that reads ground truth and prediction in an already transformed data format and
          returns a distance as an evaluation result.

        - A mapping function that transforms an image datapoint into a valid input format ready to ingest by the metric
          function.

    Using :meth:`get_distance`, ground truth and prediction dataflow can be read in and evaluated.
    :meth:`dump` is a helper method that is often called via :meth:`get_distance`. Here, the dataflows should be
    executed and the results should be saved in separate lists.

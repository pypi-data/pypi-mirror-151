## Description
This project has an implementation of common algorithms in the literature, both instance selection algorithms and semi-supervised learning algorithms.

Among the objectives of the project is that the implemented algorithms are correct and complete with their respective original papers in which they were presented.

Likewise, there are multiple experiment configuration files for the aforementioned verification, and for the realization of a research process on the behavior of semi-supervised learning algorithms when noise filtering is performed.

---
## Download and installation
IS-SSL is distributed under two libraries, both are available in their last 
versions in PIP. 
- Instance Selection Algorithms. [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/InstanceSelectionDNX/).
  
````bash
pip install InstanceSelectionDNX
````

- Semi-Supervised Algorithms. [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/SemiSupervisedLearningDNX/).
````bash
pip install SemiSupervisedLearningDNX
````

Being the nature a Python project, it is easily importable from within the 
repo and its [releases](https://github.com/dpr1005/Semisupervised-learning-and-instance-selection-methods/releases).

## **1.0 Changelog** ##
> What's new in **v1.1** (v1.1) than **v1.0** (v1.0)

* Fixes (minor): Converted the ValueError for wrong password alert into a log message.

## **2.0 Usage** ##
To install and use it follow below steps as per convenience.

### 2.1 **Installation** ###
* To download, simply use pip to download it from pypi in a python3 supported environment. If you don't have python in your system, download it from python official site (https://www.python.org/downloads)
```
pip install AESRLib
```
* To contribute, fork the git repo and proceed (https://github.com/me-yutakun/AESRLib)
#### 2.1.1 Pre-requisities ####
python>=3.10, pycryptodome

### 2.2 **Using it** ###
#### 2.2.1 With IDE/IDLE ####
First, import the module using:
```
from AESRLib import AESRandomizer as alib
```
And you are ready to go! The interactive function to trigger AESR for ready-to-use purpose is:
```
alib.initializer(filename)
```
filename - Its the input filename given with extension for processing like 'test.txt'
Providing the abstract function for instant use makes the user's task too easy and readily accessible
Ensure that the script using AESR is run in the **same root folder** as the file.

#### 2.2.2 With CMD/PS/Terminal ####
A ready to use way for running it without any hassle, just follow the steps (after installation of AESRLib as referred above):
1. Download/Copy the main.py file in a folder locally (main.py file is available in https://github.com/me-yutakun/AESRLib)
2. Go to that folder and open cmd/powershell/terminal
3. Place the file you want to encrypt/decrypt in same folder
4. Type ``` python main.py``` in cmd/powershell/terminal then press enter

**Recommended**: If screen is exiting too fast after showing error or you are not able to see the result properly use this way to run it.

## **3.0 Future Proposals** ##
1. Includes enhancement for randomization function
2. Bug fixes

## **4.0 LICENSE** ##

Detecting Bias and ensuring Fairness in AI solutions

This package is used to detect and mitigate biases in NLP tasks. The model is an end-to-end framework that takes data into a raw form, preprocess it, detect the various types of biases and mitigate them. The output is the text that is free from bias.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Dbias.

```bash
pip install Dbias
pip install https://huggingface.co/d4data/en_pipeline/resolve/main/en_pipeline-any-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

To de-bias a news article
```python
from Dbias.text_debiasing import * 

# returns unbiased recommendations for a given sentence fragment.
run("Billie Eilish issues apology for mouthing an anti-Asian derogatory term in a resurfaced video.")
```

To Classify a news article whether it's biased or not
```python
from Dbias.bias_classification import *

# returns classification label for a given sentence fragment.
classifier("Nevertheless, Trump and other Republicans have tarred the protests as havens for terrorists intent on destroying property.")
```

To Recognize the biased words/phrases
```python
from Dbias.bias_recognition import *

# returns extracted biased entities from a given sentence fragment
recognizer("Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion.")
```

To Mask out the biased portions of a given sentence fragment
```python
from Dbias.bias_masking import *

# returns extracted biased entities from a given sentence fragment
masking("The fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned.")
```

## About
This is a collective pipeline comprises of 3 Transformer models to de-bias/reduce amount of bias in news articles. The three models are:
- An English sequence classification model, trained on the [**MBIC Dataset**](https://github.com/Media-Bias-Group/Neural-Media-Bias-Detection-Using-Distant-Supervision-With-BABE), to detect bias and fairness in sentences (news articles). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased model and trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 16, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 512.
- An Entity Recognition model, which is is trained on MBIC Dataset to recognize the biased word/phrases in a sentence. This model was built on top of roberta-base offered by Spacy transformers.
- A Masked Language model, which is a Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.

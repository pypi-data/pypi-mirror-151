# Puddler (Emby/Jellyfin-MPV-Client)
Emby/Jellyfin command line client, powered by mpv.

### Currently, in extreme buggy alpha state.
___

### Installation:
```
$ python -m pip install Puddler --upgrade
$ python -m puddler
```

**Latest update:**

+ Rewrote everything about the configuration, add sweet getch functions and useless printing.
+ playback will be improved in the next update/commit

___

### Information:

Currently, not a lot of features.

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term and some ridiculous playlist mode.

___

Instead of a list with features, here is a to-do list:

- flawless playback of multiple episodes
- functional playback on windows (script freezes when closing mpv without finishing it)
- actual good playback report

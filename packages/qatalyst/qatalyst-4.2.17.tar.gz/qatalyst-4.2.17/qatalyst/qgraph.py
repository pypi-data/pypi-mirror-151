    :param chromatic_ub: optional, int, default = None. An upper bound on the chromatic number.

        If *chromatic_ub* is None, then it is estimated from

            *single_assignment_weight* replaces :math:`\\alpha` in the problem formulation.
            If there are no feasible solutions, *single_assignment_weight* can be increased
            until feasible answers are returned, with those likely to be near-optimal solutions.
            This is similar to the way a Lagrange multiplier can be optimized to better separate
            feasible and infeasible results in objective-function value, see `qcore.sample_lagrange_optimization`.
            For more formulation details, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09756.
            Note that any solution that has a node assigned to no community or more than one
            community is infeasible
            and hence modularity is not defined for it.

    size :math:`N` when :math:`k = 2`, and size :math:`kN` when :math:`k > 2`. For the barbell graph of size 10 below, and
    :math:`k=3`, this yields a problem that consumes 30 qubits.

    Bipartite graphs are often a more natural fit for real-world data. For instance, coauthorship networks are linked by
    articles written, which expand naturally to a bipartite network composed of 'author' and 'article' nodes. Below is
    an example using the classic *Davis Southern Women* network, run on *qonductor*. In this example, the nodes in the
    Davis Southern Women graph are labeled with key 'bipartite' which takes a value of either 0 or 1.

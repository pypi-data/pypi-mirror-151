# TNO MPC Lab - MPyC - Stubs

The TNO MPC lab consists of generic software components, procedures, and functionalities developed and maintained on a regular basis to facilitate and aid in the development of MPC solutions. The lab is a cross-project initiative allowing us to integrate and reuse previously developed MPC functionalities to boost the development of new protocols and solutions.

The package tno.mpc.mpyc.stubs is part of the TNO Python Toolbox.

This package contains stubs to use for type hinting [MPyC](https://github.com/lschoe/mpyc).

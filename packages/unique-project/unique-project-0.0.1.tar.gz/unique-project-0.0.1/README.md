To install the function you need to execute a command:
"python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps Unique-function"
this package is able to identify the unique characters of the transmitted line and text from the file.
to define unique characters from a string, run the command:
--string "your text"
to determine the unique characters of the file, run the command:
--file "path/to/file"
when executing two commands, the --file has higher priority

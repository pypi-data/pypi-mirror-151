"The ``Address`` tab shows text address data for the location from where "

"``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is "
"rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no "
"requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from "
"a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, "
"e.g. \"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA "
"or a county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 "
"letter `ISO code`_. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a "
"continent or sub-continent. More detail about these can be found on the "

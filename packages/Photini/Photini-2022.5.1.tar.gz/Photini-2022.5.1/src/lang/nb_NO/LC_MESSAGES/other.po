"differ in appearance, and show different levels of detail for different "
"parts of the world. You should use the one that you like best, but it's "

"You may be able use the map's navigation and zoom controls to find the "

"Note that the search is biased towards the current map location, so you "
"might want to zoom out and pan to the right continent before searching. "
"Type a search term into the box and hit return. A list of results should "

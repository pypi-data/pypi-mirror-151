**This site is intended to be a wiki/documentation site for everything that we open-sourced from the paper.** There are three main folders: the annotator, utilities (dataloaders, download tools, pretrained models, etc), and a code dump of stuff from the paper that is just for reference. 

(Check out the main site for an overview of 'steerable datastes' and the 3D â†’ 2D rendering pipeline).

#### Download the code
If you want to see and edit the code, then you can clone the github and install with: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EPFL-VILAB/omnidata-tools
cd omnidata-tools
pip install -e .    # this will install the python requirements (and also install the CLI)
```
This is probably the best option for you if you want to use the pretrained models, dataloaders, etc in other work.

#### Install just CLI tools (`omnitools`)
If you are only interested in using the [CLI tools](/omnidata-tools/omnitools.html), you can install them with: `pip install omnidata-tools`. This might be preferable if you only want to quickly download the starter data, or if you just want a simple way to manipulate the vision datasets output by the annotator.

_Note:_ The annotator can also be used with a [docker-based](/omnidata-tools/annotator_usage.html) CLI, but you don't need to use the annotator to use the starter dataset, pretrained models, or training code.

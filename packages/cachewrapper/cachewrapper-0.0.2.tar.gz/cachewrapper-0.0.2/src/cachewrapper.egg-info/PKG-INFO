    **Use case**: you have modules or objects whose methods you want to call. These calls might be expensive (e.g. rate-limited API calls). Thus you do not want to make unnecessary calls which would only give results that you already have. However, during testing repeatedly calling these methods is unavoidable. *Cachewrapper* solves this by automatically providing a cache for all calls.

Description: # Scrapy Demo Cloudwatch Log
        
        Adds a log line that is easy to parse with Cloudwatch filters to create a useful
        metric. To enable:
        
        ```
        EXTENSIONS = {
            'scrapy_demo_cloudwatch_log.DemoLogger': 100
        }
        ```
        
        Then you can use this filter expression: `{ $.eventType = "ScrapyCrawlSummary" }`.
        It creates the demo metric `$.item_scraped_count`.
        The `$.spider` can be used as a dimension.

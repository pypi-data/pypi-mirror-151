Description: # ColorSpot
        
        This script is a command line DX cluster client. It adds the following benefits to the default telnet stream:
        
          * displays the DX station's country
          * displays the DX station's continent
          * displays if the DX station uses LotW
          * downloads your LotW QSL file and marks all lines with countries that need to be confirmed (optional)
          * displays lines in different colors depending on the continent or band (user configurable)

        # Limitations
        
        The following limitations are present:
        
          * read-only: you can't send commands to the dx cluster server via this tool
          * no filters: you need to configure your filter on the server
        
        # Installation
        
        ColorSpot needs Python 3 and the following libraries:
        
         * colored
         * requests
        
        Furthermore, you need an account at LotW for some of the features.
        
        Before installing ColorSpot, please make sure that pip, setuptools and wheel are installed and up-to-date:

        ```
        
        Finally, install ColorSpot with pip:
        
        ```
        # python3 -m pip install colorspot
        ```
        
        # Updating
        
        To update colorspot, execute the following command:
        
        ```
        # python3 -m pip install --upgrade colorspot
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
         * execute the application with "colorspot"
         * colorspot creates a default config file and states its location (e.g. _~/.config/colorspot/colorspot.ini_)
         * adapt _~/.config/colorspot/colorspot.ini_ to your needs. Important setting are:
            * cluster/host and cluster/port: Change this if you want to use another cluster server
            * cluster/user: Enter here your call sign
            * lotw/user: Enter here your lotw user name (your call sign). Leave at "N0CALL" to disable this feature.
            * lotw/password: Enter here your lotw password
            * lotw/mode: Enter here the mode you would like to filter the QSL download from LotW
         * execute the application again with "colorspot"
         * the software now tries to download the following files and stores them into the configuration directory:
            * https://www.country-files.com/bigcty/download/bigcty.zip (will be extracted)
            * https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-user-activity.csv
            * https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/lotwreport.adi?login={}&password={}&qso_query=1&qso_qsl=yes&qso_mode={}&qso_qsldetail=yes&qso_qslsince=1970-01-01

> Let's make some volcanoes erupt!

__NOTE:__
The created dates *must* start before the model start. Running CESM2 from year 1850 with
the first eruption in 1850 will make it crash. Setting the first eruption to 1849,
however, will make it run. The same goes for the end, the model must stop prior to the
last event, otherwise it will crash. This project will make sure one event is placed
ahead of the `init` year, but the end will vary depending on number of events created
and their frequency.

## Install

This repo is currently intended to be installed from source only. To install all
dependencies, clone the repo and install with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking.git
cd volcano-cooking
poetry install
# or, without development dependencies:
poetry install --no-dev
```

## Usage

There are two CLI programs coming with this project. The main program is
`volcano-cooking`, which will create a `.nc` and `.npz` file in the `data/output`
directory. With the `view_frc` program you can quickly view the content of the created
files in a plot.

Run from within this repository/directory via poetry:

```sh
poetry run volcano-cooking
poetry run view-frc <file.nc>
```

or, if the virtual environment where the project is installed is activated:

```sh
volcano-cooking
view-frc <file.nc>
```

An optional flag can be sent to the `view-frc` program that will save the plot:
`view-frc -s <file.nc>`.

In either case a `data/output` directory will be created inside the current directory
when something is saved.

For more options to either `volcano-cooking` or `view-frc`, see

```sh
volcano-cooking --help
view-frc --help
```

### Option 0 (default, using NCL-script)

#### TL;DR

```console

```

#### Dependencies

This option needs

- `volcano-cooking` installed
- A coordinate file (~ 10 kB)
- [`ncl`](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/) executable

#### Create source file for forcing

Run command `volcano-cooking` with the options you want. See `volcano-cooking --help`.

#### Create forcing file for CESM2

> Running the [_script/create_cesm_frc.sh](_script/create_cesm_frc.sh) script depends on
> having `ncl` installed. See installation instructions
> [here](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/).

After having run the `volcano-cooking` command, the forcing file for CESM2 can be
generated by running

```sh
sh _script/create_cesm_frc.sh
```

If the needed coordinate files are missing, you will be asked if you want to download
them. If you want to use different files, or change the default resolution (default is
2 degrees), edit [_script/create_cesm_frc.sh](_script/create_cesm_frc.sh) accordingly.
In this case, you also need to manually download whatever coordinate file you want to
use. See section [Setting up manually](#setting-up-manually).

#### Wrap up

The last created files, source files, logs and final output, can be nicely collected and
placed in a directory named `source-files` with command:

```sh
sh _script/package_last.sh
```

<details><summary><h4>Setting up manually</h4></summary><br>

To be able to create forcing files used by CESM2 from the newly created synthetic file,
we need a script from the [emissions][data_source_files] directory. These are scripts
that use the forcing file this project generates to make a new, full forcing file that
CESM2 accepts (examples of such files can be found [here][volc-frc-complete]). For
example, `createVolcEruptV3.ncl` can be found in the [emissions][data_source_files]
directory. This need a `common.ncl` file, found [here][common-ncl], in addition to other
standard `ncl` libraries. Make sure to edit `createVolcEruptV3.ncl` to read the created
file and that the first and last year cover those used in the created file. A working
version of `createVolcEruptV3.ncl` that uses input files generated by `volcano-cooking`
can be found in [data/originals](data/originals). To see what was changed from the
original, run `diff createVolcEruptV3.ncl createVolcEruptV3.ncl.original`.

Coordinate files are needed when running `createVolcEruptV3.ncl` or similar scripts, and
are located [here][coord-file]. For example `fv_1.9x2.5_L30.nc` which can be used with
two degrees resolution in the atmosphere model. The following commands will download
1 and 2 degree resolution coordinate files, respectively, to the `data/originals`
directory:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/coords/fv_0.9x1.25_L30.nc --directory-prefix data/originals
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/coords/fv_1.9x2.5_L30.nc --directory-prefix data/originals
```

</details>

### Option 1 (directly change forcing file)

#### TL;DR

```console
$ volcano-cooking -f 1 -s 100 -o
Generating with 'GenerateFPP'...
```

#### Dependencies

This option needs

- `volcano-cooking` installed
- A coordinate file (~ 10 kB)
- Original CESM2 forcing file (~ 2.2 GB)

#### Run library

Now the only thing we need to do is running `volcano-cooking` with the flag `-o`, and
choose the type of forcing we want (see `volcano-cooking --lst`):

```sh
volcano-cooking -f 1 -s 100 -o
```

<details><summary><h4>Get forcing and coordinate files manually</h4></summary><br>

> Manually downloading the files and placing them in the correct directory is *not*
> needed. Running the command as shown above will ask you if you want to download the
> files, and place them where they need to be.

This option relies on having a working forcing file and coordinate file at hand. We will
use the forcing file that CESM2 places in the `stratvolc` directory of the `cam` model.
Download from [this link][stratvolc-forcing] and place it in the `data/originals`
directory, or run command:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/chem/stratvolc/VolcanEESMv3.11_SO2_850-2016_Mscale_Zreduc_2deg_c191125.nc --directory-prefix data/originals
```

It's 2.2Â GB file, so it will take some time.

We will also need a coordinate file, specifically `fv_1.9x2.5_L30.nc` which is found
[here][coord-file]. This file is small and quick to download. From the command line:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/coords/fv_0.9x1.25_L30.nc --directory-prefix data/originals
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/coords/fv_1.9x2.5_L30.nc --directory-prefix data/originals
```

</details>

## Extra

### Compare created file with a similar used in a default CESM2 experiment

A similar file to those that are created is needed to be able to use some scripts in the
`helper_scripts` directory. By default, it assumes the file is named
`volcan-eesm_global_2015_so2-emissions-database_v1.0.nc` and that it is placed inside
the `data/originals` directory. You can find this file [here][volc-frc].

# Wordle parser

This is a python script which takes your chat history as input (exported from a
popular chat-app, for example), and outputs the average scores of all of your
group members, for a variety of wordle clones.

## Usage

    pip install wordleparser
    wordleparse chat.txt

As of now, it is only tested to work with a WhatsApp chat export.

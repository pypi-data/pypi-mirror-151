- Fixed a bug where the age pyramid was being unintentionally modified in-place.
- *GitHub info*: PR `128 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/128>`__


Version 0.6.4 (2021-06-10)
--------------------------
- Added a ``MultiSim`` class, which can handle parallel runs and uncertainty bounds.
- *GitHub info*: PR `124 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/124>`__


Version 0.6.3 (2021-06-10)
--------------------------
- Fixed a bug where exposure correction by age was accidentally being clipped to the range [0,1], restoring behavior of the array-based model to match the object-based model (notwithstanding stochastic effects and other bugfixes).
- *GitHub info*: PR `119 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/119>`__


Version 0.6.2 (2021-05-10)

- *GitHub info*: PR `100 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/100>`__


Version 0.6.1 (2021-05-02)
--------------------------
- Renamed ``fp.Calibration`` to ``fp.Experiment``, and added a new ``fp.Calibration`` class, using Optuna.
- This allows the user to do e.g. ``calib = fp.Calibration(pars); calib.calibrate(calib_pars)``
- Calibrating a single parameter takes about 20 seconds for a single parameter and a small population size (500 people). Realistic calibrations should take roughly 10 - 60 minutes.
- *GitHub info*: PR `93 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/93>`__


Version 0.6.0 (2021-05-01)
--------------------------
- Refactored the model to use an array-based implementation, instead of a loop over individual people.
- This results in a performance increase of roughly 20-100x, depending on the size of the simulation. In practice, this means that 50,000 people can be run in roughly the same amount of time as 500 could be previously.
- *GitHub info*: PR `92 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/92>`__


Version 0.5.2 (2021-04-30)
--------------------------
- Added a new script, ``preprocess_data.py``, that takes large raw data files and preprocesses them down to only the essentials used in the model.
- This increases the performance of ``calib.run()`` (**not** counting model runtime) by a factor of 1000.
- *GitHub info*: PR `91 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/91>`__


Version 0.5.1 (2021-04-29)
--------------------------
- Added ``summarize()`` and ``to_json()`` methods to ``Calibration``. Also added an ``fp.diff_summaries()`` method for comparing them.
- Added regression and benchmarking tests (current total time: 24 s).
- Added a code coverage script (current code coverage: 59%).
- Added default flags for which quantities to compute.
- Split the logic of ``Calibration`` out into more detail: e.g., initialization, running, and post-processing.
- *GitHub info*: PR `90 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/90>`__

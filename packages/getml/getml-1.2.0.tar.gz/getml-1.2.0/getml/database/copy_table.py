    Copies a table from one database connection to another.

    Example:
        A frequent use case for this function is to copy data from a data source into
        sqlite. This is a good idea, because sqlite is faster than most standard,
        ACID-compliant databases and also you want to avoid messing up a productive
        environment.

        It is important to explicitly pass conn_id, otherwise the source connection
        will be closed
        when you create the target connection. What you pass as conn_id is entirely
        up to you,
        as long as the conn_id of the source and the target are different. It can
        be any name you see fit.

        >>> source_conn = getml.database.connect_odbc(
        ...     "MY-SERVER-NAME", conn_id="MY-SOURCE")
        >>>
        >>> target_conn = getml.database.connect_sqlite3(
        ...     "MY-SQLITE.db", conn_id="MY-TARGET")
        >>>
        >>> data.database.copy_table(
        ...         source_conn=source_conn,
        ...         target_conn=target_conn,
        ...         source_table="MY-TABLE"
        ... )

    Args:
        source_conn (:class:`~getml.database.Connection`):
            The database connection to be copied from.

        target_conn (:class:`~getml.database.Connection`):
            The database connection to be copied to.

        source_table (str):
            The name of the table in the source connection.

        target_table (str, optional):
            The name of the table in the target
            connection. If you do not explicitly pass a target_table, the
            name will be identical to the source_table.

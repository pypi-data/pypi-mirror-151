"""This module contains communication routines to access various databases.

The :func:`~getml.database.connect_bigquery`,
:func:`~getml.database.connect_hana`,
:func:`~getml.database.connect_greenplum`,
:func:`~getml.database.connect_mariadb`,
:func:`~getml.database.connect_mysql`,
:func:`~getml.database.connect_postgres`, and
:func:`~getml.database.connect_sqlite3` functions establish a
connection between a database and the getML engine. During the data
import using either the :meth:`~getml.DataFrame.read_db` or
:meth:`~getml.DataFrame.read_query` methods of a
:class:`~getml.DataFrame` instance or the corresponding
:func:`~getml.DataFrame.from_db` class method all data will be
directly loaded from the database into the engine without ever passing
the Python interpreter.

In addition, several auxiliary functions that might be handy during
the analysis and interaction with the database are provided.

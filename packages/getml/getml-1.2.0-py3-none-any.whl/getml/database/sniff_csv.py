    Sniffs a list of CSV files.

    Args:
        name (str):
            Name of the table in which the data is to be inserted.

        fnames (List[str]):
            The list of CSV file names to be read.

        num_lines_sniffed (int, optional):
            Number of lines analyzed by the sniffer.

        quotechar (str, optional):
            The character used to wrap strings. Default:`"`

        sep (str, optional):
            The separator used for separating fields. Default:`,`

        skip (int, optional):
            Number of lines to skip at the beginning of each
            file (Default: 0).

        colnames(List[str] or None, optional):
            The first line of a CSV file
            usually contains the column names. When this is not the case, you need to
            explicitly pass them.

        conn (:class:`~getml.database.Connection`, optional):
            The database connection to be used.
            If you don't explicitly pass a connection,

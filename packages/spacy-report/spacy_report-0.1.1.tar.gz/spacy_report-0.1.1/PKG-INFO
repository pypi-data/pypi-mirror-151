        # spacy-report
        
        > The goal of this project is to generate reports for [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) models.
        
        ## what it does
        
        The goal of `spacy-report` is to offer static reports for spaCy models that
        help users make better decisions on how the models can be used. At the 
        moment the project supports interactive views for threshold values for classification. 
        
        Here's a preview of what to expect:

        There are two kinds of charts.
        
        1. The first kind is a density chart. This chart shows the distribution
        of confidence scores for a given class. The blue area represents documents
        that had the tag assigned to the class. The orange area represents documents
        that didn't.
        2. The second kind is a line chart that demonstrates the accuracy, precision
        and recall values for a given confidence threshold. It's an interactive chart
        and you can explore the values by hovering over the chart.
        
        ## install 
        
        You can install `spacy_report` directly with pip. 
        
        ```
        python -m pip install spacy_report
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can also install the most version from git. 
        
        ```
        python -m pip install "spacy_report @ git+https://github.com/koaning/spacy_report.git"
        ```
        
        ## usage
        
        The `accuracy` project provides a command line interface that can
        generate reports. The full CLI can also be explored via the `--help` flag. 
        
        ```
        > python -m spacy report --help
        Usage: python -m spacy report [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
          Generate reports for spaCy models.
        
        Options:
          --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Commands:
          textcat  Generate a report for textcat models.
          version  Print the version of spacy_report.
        ```
        
        ### `textcat report`
        
        To generate reports for textcat models, you can use the `textcat` sub-command.
        
        ```
        > python -m spacy report textcat training/model-best/ corpus/train.spacy corpus/dev.spacy
        
        Loading model at training/model-best
        Running model on training data...
        Running model on development data...
        Generating Charts ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
        Done! You can view the report via;
        
        python -m http.server --directory reports PORT 
        ```
        
        This will generate a folder, "reports" by default, that contains a full 
        dashboard for the trained spaCy model found in `training/model-best`. 
        
        The CLI has a few configurable settings:
        
        ```text
        Arguments:
          [MODEL_PATH]  Path to spaCy model
          [TRAIN_PATH]  Path to training data
          [DEV_PATH]    Path to development data
          [FOLDER_OUT]  Output folder for reports  [default: reports]
        
        Options:
          --classes TEXT  Comma-separated string of classes to use
          --help          Show this message and exit.
        ```
